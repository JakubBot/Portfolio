        <p>
          I am a <span className="light-dark">4th-semester</span> Computer
          Science student at the Gdańsk University of Technology with 2 years of
          commercial experience in Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into coding began in high school, where I started with C,
          then moved on to C++, C#, and eventually <span className="light-dark">JavaScript</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right after graduation, I began working remotely as a <span className="light-dark">Frontend
          Developer</span> at Aeropage.io, where I was responsible for building tools
          integrated with Airtable. Working in a team taught me the importance
          of effective communication, task planning, and always asking, ‘What is
          the purpose of this feature?’.
        </p>
        <p>
          After over a year, I started studying at the <span className="light-dark">Gdańsk University of
          Technology</span>, where I am currently pursuing my degree. Balancing work
          and studies has given me valuable experience in time management and
          multitasking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my two years at university, <span className="light-dark">I’ve</span> explored a wide range of
          topics — from low-level programming in assembly and writing Bash scripts
          to understanding data structures and analyzing their time complexity.
